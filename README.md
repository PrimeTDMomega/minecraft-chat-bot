## How to Use

To use the code I provided, you will need to follow these steps:

 1. Install the Minecraft API: You will need to install the Minecraft API in order to use the code. You can download the API from the official Minecraft website or from a third-party source
 2.  Set up a Java development environment: You will need to set up a Java development environment on your computer in order to compile and run the code. This will typically involve installing the Java Development Kit (JDK) and a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.
    
2.  Copy the code into a Java file: Copy the code I provided into a new Java file in your development environment. Be sure to save the file with a .java extension.
    
3.  Modify the code as needed: You may want to modify the code to customize the behavior of your bot or add additional functionality. For example, you could add additional commands that the bot will respond to, or modify the way the bot responds to the "!coords" command.
    
4.  Compile the code: Use your development environment to compile the code into a Java class file.
    
5.  Run the code: Use your development environment to run the code and start your Minecraft bot. You may need to provide your Minecraft login credentials in order to connect to the server.
    
6.  Test the bot: Once the bot is running, you can test it by joining a Minecraft server and sending the "!coords" command in the chat. The bot should respond with its current coordinates.
